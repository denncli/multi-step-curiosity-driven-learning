After running the code to train the mario environment, you will get .bk2 files/

If they are not in a folder already, you can put all those files in a separate folder 
and run the following command 

python3 ./scripts/convertbk2-mp4.py ./results/bk2/SuperMarioBros-Nes-Level1-1-xxxxxx.bk2 

to convert just one file into mp4

If you want to conver all the files to mp4, run the command

python3 -m retro.scripts.playback_movie ./results/bk2/SuperMarioBros-Nes-Level1-1-xxxxxx.bk2
